Hey! My name is Matthew Henderson and I’m a Sophomore at the University of Missouri. I plan on graduating in Spring 2022 with a bachelors in Atmospheric Science with a minor in Geography. I am searching for a career with the National Weather Service or FEMA after college. I have absolutely zero web application or development training or experience, this is my first class on it and my first online class as well (before the virus anyhow). If I’m being honest, I’m not sure what my expectations would be, trying to expand my skill set for the most part. Hopefully I will be able to help someone close to me if they ever needed help making a website or advice. My favorite hobby would have to be biking/hiking, a conservation and wildlife advocate. The outdoors is one thing I could never get sick of, nature is to fascinating to ignore.
