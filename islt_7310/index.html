<p> Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew! A full-time student at the University of Missouri.</p>
<p>I am 20-year old studying to be a Meteorologist so I can help people in the community. I was born in Kansas City, Missouri and grew up in a small farm town for most of my life. A huge fan of the legendary Kansas City BBQ and baseball, not to forget my movie obsession! My passion lies in mathematics, science, and weather. The real inspiration for who I want to become came from science shows like Bill Nye/Neil Degrasse Tyson and broadcast meteorologist such as Brian Busby/Mike Thompson. Hoping one day to use my skills to protect and connect our nation.</p>

<p>Heres a quote from my favorite movie!</p>
